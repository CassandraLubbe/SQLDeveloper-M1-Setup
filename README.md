# SQLDeveloper-M1-Setup
Step-by-step guide on installing and running SQL Developer on a Mac M1/M2 chip.  

These were the steps that helped me run SQLDeveloper with Oracle 21c (xe) on my Macbook M1, as it was part of a **Computer Science (University) course**.  
Please feel free to let me know of simplified ways, but this helped me ensure that I got to use SQLDeveloper in the same manner my (windows) classmates did, and follow along with the lecturer.  

**NOTE!** You can pull other docker images, however, for this example, I'm focusing on gvenzl/oracle-xe rather than the latest which is gvenzl/oracle-free.  


## Step One: Prerequisites
### **SQLDeveloper**: Install SQLDeveloper.app
  * Install SQLDeveloper from [Oracle Download Page](https://www.oracle.com/za/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/)  
  * Unzip (if not already unzipped) and drag SQLDeveloper.app into your Applications folder.  
  * üõë Check that JDK installed (if it was part of the download package or follow link below to install)  
    * In your terminal run:  
          `java -version`  
    You should have an output displaying the the Java version on your system. Note: It might be Openjdk, that's alright too.  
    *If Java is **NOT** installed (which was my case), you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/za/java/technologies/downloads/).  
    *Rerun the above code in your terminal again, to ensure Java was installed and a version of Java is being displayed.  

### **Colima**: Install Colima
  * [Homebrew Colima Page](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/colima)  
  * Alternatively, run the following code:  
        `brew install colima`  

### **Docker**: Install Docker
  * [Homebrew Docker Page](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/docker)  
  * Alternatively, run the following code:  
        `brew install docker`  

## Step Two: Getting Started
  ‚≠ê Inside your terminal, you'll run the following code.  
  * Because Oracle Database has no port for ARM Chips, a docker image needs to run through colima.  
  * Enter the following code in your terminal:  
        Run `colima start --arch x86_64 --memory`  
  *It will take a moment to run if you're running it the first time, but once it's done, you can move to the next step.*   
  * **You might be prompted to install QEMU, follow the instructions on your terminal to install it.**  

## Step Three: Setup Oracle-xe Docker
‚≠ê For my course, I needed Oracle Database 21c, therefore I used the below. However, Database 23c is available on another docker image (details for latest provided on linked page).  
  * Oracle 21c [gvenzl/oracle-xe](https://hub.docker.com/r/gvenzl/oracle-xe)  
  * Pull the image you want, for example, mine was:  
        `docker pull gvenzl/oracle-xe`  
  * Once the download is complete, you can move onto running the container.  
  * *Replace <your_password> in the below code, with your own password.*  
        Run `docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your_password> gvenzl/oracle-xe`  
      *It might take a moment.*  
  * Check that the docker is running:  
        `docker ps`  

## Step Three: Check SQLDeveloper Connection
  * Open SQLDeveloper and select ‚ûï in the top left corner of the screen to create **New Connection** window.  
  * Enter the name for your database, the username, password (*password you created during docker run*), and the connection should be:  
      >**Hostname**: localhost  
      >**Port**: 1521  
      >**SID**: xe  

## Additional:
### Accessing SQLPLUS for Container DB
‚≠ê If you want access SQLPLUS for the container databse:  
  * Ensure your docker is running, by running the following code: **REPLACE** oracle-xe with your container name.  
        `docker start oracle-xe`  
  * Access SQLPLUS by running this code: **REPLACE** oracle-xe with your container name.  
        `docker exec -it oracle-xe bash`  
    Inside bash run: `sqlplus / as sysdba`  
  **OR**  
        `docker exec -it oracle-xe sqlplus / as sysdba`  

**Accessing pluggable database info will be added soon...**
